- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @O-W-En!
- ðŸ‘€ I just so happen to be a computational chemist interested in MD simulations â€” specifically classical MD because I work in the biochemical field, but I'm trying to dabble in some relativistic quantum MD (for fun). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently getting a BSc. in Chemistry from Cal, and hoping to get a PhD. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/They
